Problem Statement:

Urban traffic congestion leads to delays, increased pollution, and reduced quality of life. Develop an AI-driven solution for smart traffic management that optimizes traffic flow and reduces congestion in real-time.

Challenge:

Create a concept for a smart traffic management system that

the system would improve traffic flow and reduce travel times in urban areas.

## Ideas

-   Mount cameras on traffic signals
-   Re route traffic when there is a jam, integrated into GPS
-   Signal times can be adjusted depending on the amount of traffic, with a cap on the total time per round.
